title: Badges
---

Easily highlight new or unread items by adding a <span class="badge"> to links, Bootstrap navs, and more.

<h4>Self collapsing</h4>
<p>When there are no new or unread items, badges will simply collapse (via CSS's <code>:empty</code> selector) provided no content exists within.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger" id="callout-badges-ie8-empty">
	<h4>Cross-browser compatibility</h4>
	<p>Badges won't self collapse in Internet Explorer 8 because it lacks support for the <code>:empty</code> selector.</p>
</div>

<h4>Adapts to active nav states</h4>
<p>Built-in styles are included for placing badges in active states in pill navigations.</p>

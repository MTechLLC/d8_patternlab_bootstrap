title: Input Groups Button
---

  <h2 id="input-groups-buttons">Button addons</h2>
  <p>Buttons in input groups are a bit different and require one extra level of nesting. Instead of <code>.input-group-addon</code>, you'll need to use <code>.input-group-btn</code> to wrap the buttons. This is required due to default browser styles that cannot be overridden.</p>
